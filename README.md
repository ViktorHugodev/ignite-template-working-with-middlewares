# Working with middlewares - NodeJs

### ðŸ’» About the challenge


In this challenge you will work more in depth with middleware in Express. That way you will be able to further fix the knowledge obtained so far.

To facilitate a little more knowledge of the business rule, you will work with the same application as in the previous challenge: an application to manage tasks (or *all*) but with some changes.

It will be allowed the creation of a user with `name` and `username`, as well as doing the CRUD of *all*:

- Create a new *todo*;
- List all *all*;
- Change the `title` and `deadline` of an existing *whole*;
- Mark a *whole* as done;
- Delete a *whole*;

All this for each specific user. In addition, this time we will have a free plan where the user can only create up to ten *all* and a Pro plan that will allow creating unlimited *all*, all of this using middleware to perform the necessary validations.

Next we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done ðŸš€
